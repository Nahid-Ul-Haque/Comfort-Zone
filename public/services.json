        "description": "A spiral computed tomography (CT) scan takes images using radiation. ... Spiral CT uses a faster machine that spins continuously around the body. This allows it to more quickly detect images and spot problems. It can also detect small nodules (early-stage lung disease) that cannot be clearly seen on chest x-rays.",
